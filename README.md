# Bitcoin Price Forecasting with LSTM

This repository explores time series forecasting using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Bitcoin prices. It walks through the full pipeline — from fetching historical data and preprocessing, to training an LSTM model and visualizing predictions.

The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning models can capture temporal patterns in financial time series data, and to evaluate their performance on real-world data using key metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

Ideal for those interested in applying machine learning to cryptocurrency markets and financial forecasting.
